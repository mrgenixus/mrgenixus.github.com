          I'm looking for an opportunity to express myself as a craftsman, to be
          part of a technical community and to build professional relationshipes.
          I hope to be assigned tasks of real complexity and difficulty that will
          challenge me, and afford me opportunities to learn things and teach them
          to others. Finally, I want to be part of a team that values my
          contributions whether the work I do is meaninful beyond that or not.

          My experience has taught me to be flexible. My technical skills are focused in
          application development and product design.  I like to write articulate
          software that uses appropriate abstractions to produce an implementation that
          reflects and is accessible to fluent developers.

              Working with a client as a dedicated resource, I was responsible
              for helping them to complete goals on a tight schedule providing a
              superior level of quality in both product and process-compliance.
              I worked closely with the clients staff to complete a challenging
              initiative in a complex, in-house, legacy framework, created by
              senior architects who had left the company.  I hit the ground
              running and impressed the client with my fluency and understanding
              of their complex application.

              Working with a loosely defined goal of test-driving the
              consultancy's many applications, I built a tool that allowed a
              user to load and save a url in an iframe and record an interaction
              with that site.  Difficult timing and other issues with working in
              this way eventually proved we had taken the wrong approach.
              Ultimately, the internal project was shut down after a pivot
              proved unsuccessful.

              Built as a specialized application for a particular conference's
              schedule and attendees, this application handled a number of
              difficult contraints.  Working on a tight budget, we had to define
              a limited set of features that would deliver the tool working
              without exhausting the client's wishlist and budget.

              Already well-underway, I joined this project to help with
              online/offline syncing when the application lost connectivity.  I
              worked primarily with managing inter-dependent state changes as I
              informed the client of each resource state change that it had
              missed while disconnected.  I also worked to display a series
              of views in the client related to achievements, and other kinds of
              notifications that appeared as full-screen visuals.  Lastly, this project
              afforded me an opportunity to work with a developer who was still
              junior as it concerned working with javaScript and single-page
              applications.

              Originally started by a web-consultancy, this project suffered
              from being neglected at times and I undertook the project with a
              great deal of work in progress.  My principal accomplishment on
              this project was returing the project to a good state, from a
              process and completion standpoint by picking up the incomplete
              work and pushing it over the line to release.  Also, this project
              put me in the CSS front-end more than ususal and was a nice place
              to sharpen those skills.

              This project was essentially a repayment on technical debt and
              represented a good case for technical bankruptcy.  That said, we
              managed to bring test coverage over 80% with primarily feature
              tests and were able to move to a more concise codebase overall.
              Done for primarily non-technical clients, explaining goals and
              delays was a critical part of this projects ultimate success. I
              would say that the biggest takeaway from this project was the
              importance of distilling a customer's description of an
              implementation to that of the customer's goal so that an effective
              solution could be proposed that was a good fit for the customer's
              goal rather than their conception of how to meet that goal, in the
              abstract.

              This project centered around a loyalty program that was sold
              white-label to retailers.  It allowed the retailer to publish
              discounts, perks, and events within the app based on a complex set
              of groups, tags, and other end-user information. This project dealt
              with accounting, transactional data, and multi-tenant concerns.

              This project involved working with front-end bugfixes on a complex
              process-tracking software built with Django and Backbonejs.  Most
              work was with solving the issues that crop up with using ephemeral
              backbonejs views with jquery plugins like tipsy and select2. The
              plugins are not geared toward intelligently cleaning up zombie
              popups when the related DOM elements are removed and must be
              expressly managed by the application.

              Intended to help a company meet a looming deadline, this
              engagement became a client-developer moral building excercise.
              As a resourced developer tasked with working within the client's
              process, I focused on helping the teams developers feel confident
              and improve their process, add testing, and improve release process
              over the time while I was there.

              The supply-side platform integration implemented a database-backed
              configuration system. I implemented a specified XML interchange,
              generated from hundreds of distinct configuration criteria.  Many
              features of the configuration system support demand-side
              integration, and specific targeting criteria for campaigns,
              managed in a robust single-page interface.

              The content delivery system was designed for delivering ad-integrated
              video, video playlists, and stand-alone video ad players, as a drop-in
              solution for a wide variety of content publishers.  The system was
              integrated with Amazon's S3 cloud/CDN tools and imported from several
              kinds of media sources, including MRSS, and HTTP.

              code quality, and production-readiness.  I developed and documented the
              release process.

              This product was designed to be an immersive companion for
              sports spectators; The concept was to improve sharing and accesibility
              for amateur and secondary intermural sports.  The biggest challenge is
              that most spectators can't be gamified to score games.

              The system took in a complex XML document, parsed values from it,
              presented the values, and saved the modified values back to the file on
              a server, using a PHP proxy;  The interface was configured seperately by
              a json configuration file managed in a seperate interface.  In spite of
              an unclear specification, the project was completed to a better-than-
              anticipated quality in a very short period of time.

              Built-to-order: this training program was pitched as a 'game' and turned
              out to be a complex training system used to train managers.  A partner
              built a back-end, and I implemented a tightly-specified visual layout,
              more suited to a client application than the web.  The application
              presented several levels of work to be comepleted by participants, a
              key-based payment verification system,and pay-pal integrated activation.

              This actually represents more than one project. Most significantly, I
              significantly refactored the sports Statitistics Reporting tool for
              varvee.com.  Initially, the system was designed to provide a specific
              datastream to a vendor: Untimately, the datastream was used by a
              JavaScript consumer which displayed the results in a tabular format.
