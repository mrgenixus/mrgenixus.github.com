  A. Altitude Digital
    1. Title: Senior Platform Engineer
    2. Projects/Roles
      a. Supply-Side Real-time Bidding platform Integration
        Skills/Technologies:
          - Ubuntu/OSX application deployment
          - LAMP/CakePHP
          - AWS
          - JavaScript
            - Single-Page Applications
            - Object-Oriented
            - Asynchronous
            - Functional
            - Unobtrusive jQuery

        The supply-side platform integration implemented a database-backend
        configuration system. I implemented a specified XML interchange,
        generated from hundreds of distinct configuration criteria.  Many
        features of the configuration system support demand-side integration,
        and specific targeting criteria for campaigns, managed in a robust
        single-page interface.

      b. Integrated Content Delivery System
        Skills/Technologies: 
          - LAMP/CakePHP
          - multimedia
          - encoding API integration
          - user experience design (UX)
          - cross origin scripting
          - AWS

        The content delivery system was designed for delivering ad-integrated
        video, video playlists, and stand-alone video ad players, as a drop-in
        solution for a wide variety of content publishers.  The system was
        integrated with Amazon's S3 cloud/CDN tools and imported from several
        kinds of media sources, including MRSS, and HTTP.

      c. Release Manager / Technical QA / Process
        Skills/Technologies:
          - git
          - Sprint.ly / Pivotal Tracker
          - Specifications
          - requirements
          - QA
          - Systems Administration

        As a release manager, I handled weekly deployments of new features,
        bugfixes and interations. I evaluted requirements, completion,
        code quality, and production-readiness.  I developed and documented the
        release process.

  B. Centerpivot
    1. Title: Co-Founder/Project Lead
    2. Projects/Roles
      a. Real-time Sports Scoring and Chat application
        Skills/Technologies:
          - SMS/Twilio
          - LAMP/CakePHP
          - Mobile HTML5
          - Real-time Chat
          - Trello

        <em>Like You're There</em> was designed to be an immersive companion for
        sports spectators; The concept was to improve sharing and accesibility
        for amateur and secondary intermural sports.  The biggest challenge is
        that most spectators can't be gamified to score games.

      b. XML configuration system
        Skills/Technologies
          - XML in the browser
          - Javascript
          - Single-Page application

        The system took in a complex XML document, parsed values from it,
        presented the values, and saved the modified values back to the file on
        a server, using a PHP proxy;  The interface was configured seperately by
        a json configuration file managed in a seperate interface.  In spite of
        an unclear specification, the project was completed to a better-than-
        anticipated quality in a very short period of time.

      c. Social Content Management System
        Skills/Technologies
          - Ruby on Rails
          - Stripe
          - Sendgrid
          - Devise
          - Twitter Bootstrap
          - Image/Asset Uploads

        PostSocial is a content managment system designed to serve political
        campaigns, business promoters, and service providers in creating a
        meaningful presence online.  The system's novelty centered on a treating
        as equal: events, media, and items for purchase.

  C. New Life LLC/Self-Employed/Freelance
    1. Title: Sole-proprieter
    2. Projects/Roles
      a. Training Content Display Application
        Skills/Technologies

          - Mysql
          - git
          - CSS
          - Javascript
          - PayPal
          - Youtube integration
          - HTML5 video w/ windows media fallback

        Built-to-order: this training program was pitched as a 'game' and turned
        out to be a complex training system used to train managers.  A partner
        built a back-end, and I implemented a tightly-specified visual layout,
        more suited to a client application than the web.  The application
        presented several levels of work to be comepleted by participants, a
        key-based payment verification system,and pay-pal integrated activation.

      b. Data Display System
        Skills/Technologies
          - XML
          - SQL
          - PHP
          - CSS
          - Javascript
          - embedable javascript

        This actually represents more than one project. Most significantly, I
        significantly refactored the sports Statitistics Reporting tool for
        varvee.com.  Initially, the system was designed to provide a specific
        datastream to a vendor: Untimately, the datastream was used by a
        JavaScript consumer which displayed the results in a tabular format.
