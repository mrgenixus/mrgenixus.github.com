  title: President
  title-detail: Owner
  name: Radial Development Group
  tenure: 2015 to 2024
  key-accomplishments:
    - Hired up to 40 employees and managed 20 team members at any given time. Focused on hiring for cultural fit and willingness to ask questions as opposed to only considering previous experience or education. Led efforts to increase diversity in hiring and maintained an iron-clad policy of pay equity and agency for all.
    - Spearheaded recruitment, talent management, and compensation processes with a focus on hiring from bootcamps and self-taught developers which became a valuable differentiator in the industry. Learning to layer junior developers with more experienced talent fostered a culture of learning, support, and mentoring while lowering compensation costs, creating equity, increasing retention, and building a solid talent pool.
    - Developed a value-driven plan for aligning operations, marketing, and sales; this value-based approach became the foundation for realizing the potential of the organization and ensuring that everyone was going in the right direction.
    - Initiated a company philosophy that honored the benefits of conflict; provided ongoing coaching to support staff and managers in having difficult conversations in a safe and respectful manner.
    - Conducted weekly “retrospectives” to keep managers aware of issues and bottlenecks being experienced by their team members.
    - Promoted a Director of Engineering (DOE) to conduct regular one on one meetings with technical staff to ensure projects were managed on time, on target, and to ultimately foster strong customer satisfaction.
    - Continually worked with founding partner and DOE to understand and assess organizational risk with a future-forward focus on planning for success and failure while scaling for growth; on the micro level, this same approach enabled staff to take risks, solve problems, and learn from mistakes within the scope of their roles which strengthened the culture of innovation, trust, and empowerment.
    - Utilized a modified version of scrum methodology to identify and address key customer facing deliverables every two weeks ensuring consistent, measurable progress. The process kept the focus on delivery while also addressing dynamic business needs, arising technical issues, and customer feedback.
    - Select Clients Include:  Contact Mapping, Inc., Copperleaf Creative, Saturday, Sentral, TurboTenant, Plan to Eat, ASPCA, and Bullseye.
